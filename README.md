What are the limits that define a Model Rocket vs. a High Power Rocket?:

http://www.doug79.com/stuff/HPR_metric9c.pdf
UPDATED WITH 2009 FAA regulation changes that simply eliminate the entire &#8220;Large Model Rocket&#8221;/&#8221;LMR&#8221; categlry as it is now part of &#8220;Model Rocket&#8221; and no notification is required for &#8220;Model Rockets&#8221;.

Why is the term "cato" used for motor failures?:

AIA/NAR online copy of the "How to design and build a Model Rocket" DVD. This is good info for model rockets in general, ut is very, very useful for mid to large size models with payload sections like TARC competition rockets:

 Welcome to TRF&#8217;s Beginner&#8217;s Forum, a place for newcomers to model rocketry. Whether you&#8217;re a student, adult, teacher, or youth leader, please feel free to ask your questions here&#8212;no matter how basic. And be sure and come back and post pictures of your completed rockets because we love pictures!

What are the parts of a model rocket and how do they work?
http://www.apogeerockets.com/education/rocket_parts.asp

Don&#8217;t know where to begin? Here&#8217;s a simple overview of model rocketry to get you started:
(under construction)

What supplies and equipment are needed need for a first rocket?
Model rocket kits will have a list of needed supplies, so check the manufacturer&#8217;s recommendations! Ready-to-fly kits will need few additional supplies. A typical supply list for rocket kits that require construction might look like this:

Building
Model rocket kit (Skill Level 1 suggested for beginners)
Ruler
Pencil
Hobby knife (ie Exacto brand)
Scissors
Glue (such as Elmer&#8217;s Glue-All or yellow wood glue such as Titebond II or Elmer&#8217;s Carpenter&#8217;s Glue)
Sandpaper
Masking Tape
Some kits require plastic cement (Note: the non-toxic plastic cement will not hold!)

Finishing
Sanding sealer (inexpensive, low odor sanding sealers such as Delta Ceramcoat can be found in the craft paint section at Wal-Mart or hobby/craft stores)
Paint brush for sanding sealer
Masking tape (blue paint tape works better than regular masking tape)
Spray primer
Paints (usually spray paints, for best results use same brand as primer)

Launching
Engines&#8212;check the kit instructions for manufacturer&#8217;s recommendations. The lowest power (lowest letter) engines are suggested for first flights.
Recovery wadding, igniters and igniter plugs (all typically included in engine packs)
Launch Pad
Launch Rod
Launch Controller
Batteries for the launch controller
